# CRAFS

CRAFS (Cellulose Rietveld Analysis for Fine Structure) is developed to analyze two-dimensional X-ray diffraction patterns from raw and processed plant cellulose. The current version of the CRAFS model runs in the MATLAB (version R2011b) computing language. CRAFS mathematical model is presented in a published article (see reference).

The following files are included:
 
- Zip file containing all mathematical functions and an example of input diffraction pattern.
- Tutorial explaining how to use CRAFS.
